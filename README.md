A collection of Machine Learning datasets for health care and beyond.

## Installing the package from GitHub

Here, I will use the package remotes to install the package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/StatsGary/MLDataR")
library(MLDataR)

```
## Installing the package from CRAN

To install from CRAN, use the below command:
``` r
install.packages("MLDataR")

```

## Loading the package from CRAN

To load the package from CRAN, use the following:

``` r
library(MLDataR)
```

## Datasets included

The package currently has six example datasets, and more are being added every week. The first six datasets contained in the package are:

- **Diabetes disease prediction** - supervised machine learning classification dataset to enable the prediction of diabetic patients
- **Diabetes onset prediction** - supervised machine learning regression dataset to enable prediction of the age at which a pre-diabetic will develop diabetes 
- **Heart disease prediction** - supervised machine learning classification dataset to enable the prediction of heart disease using a number of key outcome features
- **Thyroid disease prediction** - supervised machine learning classification dataset to allow for the prediction of thyroid disease utilising historic patient records
- **Failing Care Home classification** - classification supervised machine learning dataset to predict a failing care home by selected Datix incidents
- **Counter Strike Global Offensive** - supervised machine learning regression and classification data set to predict score or match outcome. 
## Further developments

More datasets are being added, so look out for the next version of this package. 

## Closing remarks

It has been fun putting this package together and I hope you find it useful. If you find any issues using the package, please raise a git hub ticket and I will address it as soon as possible. Thanks and I hope you enjoy using it.
